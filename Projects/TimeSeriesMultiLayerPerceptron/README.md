# SimpleNeuralNet
In this project, I implement a simple neural network that predicts bike sharing usage demand. You will need the following dependencies to run BikeSharingNN.ipynb:

-Numpy
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Jupyter Notebook (and respective dependecies)


Clone the repo, cd into it and run by typing:

jupyter notebook BikeSharingNN.ipynb

Enjoy!
